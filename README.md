# main()
This code is entirely c++ which was the main challenge for me. In python you type input() and you get a line, you can even do stuff like in = input("enter your first name") + "\n". In c++ it seems a bit different.
# disclaimer
I don't even know if I need one of these, use my code how you want but I will not be responsible for your actions.
# rules
in the event that you redistrubute my code I want credit so link ejware.com and github.com/EthienDuckett.
